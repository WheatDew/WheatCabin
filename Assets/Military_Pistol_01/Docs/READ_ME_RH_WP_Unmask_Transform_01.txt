When the MotusMan Avatar is set to "Humanoid", the animations by default will have the "RH_WP" bone "masked" and it will not animate the weapon properly.

In the "animation" tab under Mask>Transform, "RH_WP" needs to be checked so it will accept animation.

You can use the custom "RH_WP Avatar Mask" in the "Definition" popup list to enable the RH_WP bone. You can also make and customize your own Avatar Mask to you own specs.
