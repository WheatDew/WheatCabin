Military_Pistol_01


UNITY 3D NOTES:

1911_Pistol_01 - A matching fully textured Pistol has been included as a separate asset .fbx file. Parenting or constraining it with zero offset to the “RH_WP” bone in the right hand will place and animate it correctly.

The “Default_Setup” scene has the Pistol parented to the “RH_WP” bone in the Hierarchy with zero offset. There is a "MotusMan Animator Controller", so any animation you add to it and right-click > “Set as Default” will play/preview in the Scene viewport with the weapon in hand.

The “Default_Setup” has been included as a convenience to initially view/preview the motions with the weapon. The Scene, "MotusMan Animator Controller", and Hierarchy can be altered or deleted as you see fit for your use.

Please Note: Unity imports the animations with a default of "Keyframe Reduction", and as you might imagine this can make the hands and weapon look shaky and misplaced because of the innacuracy created. They will look much better if you set the compression to at least "Optimal".


Please see other included documentation, refer to the Unity documentation online, or contact us with any other questions.
