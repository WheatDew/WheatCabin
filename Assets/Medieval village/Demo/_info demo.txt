If you have a problem with a lot of Drawcall on the demo scene you can do three things:
1. Select terrain, check the terrains settings and setup the "Detail Distance" and "Detail Density". 
Details such as grass in large quantities can decrease a performance
2. Remove the water from the scene (or use simple shader). Reflections on the water double the number of objects to render
3. Select the camera and turn off some image effects (for example, SSAO, Vignetting, or other)
